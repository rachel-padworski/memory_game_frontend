# Memory Game
A game for all ages featuring characters from Wreck-It Ralph. “What’s going on in this candy-coated heart of darkness?” Memory Game is just a simple matching game with 24 cards. This frontend features Object Oriented JavaScript(OOJS) that creates objects from the [backend API](https://github.com/raepad/memory_game_backend). Each card represents a character - Ralph, Felix, Vanellope, etc. Enjoy!
